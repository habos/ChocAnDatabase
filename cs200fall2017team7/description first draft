Chocoholics Anonymous (ChocAn) is an organization 
dedicated to helping people addicted to chocolate. 
Our organization has been awarded the contract to 
write the ChocAn data processing software. This software 
will need to be able to validate that a person with a 
ChocAn card is indeed a current member in good standing of 
ChocAn by having a provider swipe the member card on a 
provider terminal. Additionally, the system provides support 
for billing, updates members, and automatically sends 
customized reports to members, providers, and managers on 
ChocAn information relevant to them.
