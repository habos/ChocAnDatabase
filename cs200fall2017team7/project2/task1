The system will generate reports based on data stored in the system and time and will send the reports via email.  
EFT’s will be stored onto a disk, and other data will be stored in our system. We will need a server for the records and the provider’s terminals. 
Our system will interact with the provider’s terminal system for member validation and billing, with Acme’s system when processing ChocAn membership fees, and with banking computers to credit providers’ bank accounts. 
Providers validate and bill members by swiping their cards on a provider terminal. 
For all other use cases, the system may be interacted with remotely or through local computers.
